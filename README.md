# IncriminaTor
The [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) has a tool for finding a node's uptime given an IP and a date, called [ExonaraTor](https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html). My plan for IncriminaTor is to build a web service with a similar lookup feature that will find Tor node uptimes for IPs in some published blacklists.

I'm planning on using the following blacklists for this project:
 - [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
 - [I-Blocklist](https://www.iblocklist.com/lists)
 - [ZeuS Tracker](https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/)

This list is subject to change as I find more sources of IP addresses.
